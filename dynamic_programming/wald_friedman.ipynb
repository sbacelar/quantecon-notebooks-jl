    "\n",
    "Let’s listen to Milton Friedman tell us what happened\n",
    "\n",
    "“In order to understand the story, it is necessary to have an idea of a\n",
    "simple statistical problem, and of the standard procedure for dealing\n",
    "with it. The actual problem out of which sequential analysis grew will\n",
    "serve. The Navy has two alternative designs (say A and B) for a\n",
    "projectile. It wants to determine which is superior. To do so it\n",
    "undertakes a series of paired firings. On each round it assigns the\n",
    "value 1 or 0 to A accordingly as its performance is superior or inferio\n",
    "to that of B and conversely 0 or 1 to B. The Navy asks the statistician\n",
    "how to conduct the test and how to analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The standard statistical answer was to specify a number of firings (say\n",
    "1,000) and a pair of percentages (e.g., 53% and 47%) and tell the client\n",
    "that if A receives a 1 in more than 53% of the firings, it can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if it receives a 1 in fewer than 47%, B can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if the percentage is between 47% and 53%, neither\n",
    "can be so regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When Allen Wallis was discussing such a problem with (Navy) Captain\n",
    "Garret L. Schyler, the captain objected that such a test, to quote from\n",
    "Allen’s account, may prove wasteful. If a wise and seasoned ordnance\n",
    "officer like Schyler were on the premises, he would see after the first\n",
    "few thousand or even few hundred [rounds] that the experiment need not\n",
    "be completed either because the new method is obviously inferior or\n",
    "because it is obviously superior beyond what was hoped for\n",

    "  $ H_1 $ is true, the probability is nearly $ 1 $ that the\n",
